Policy Priority Inference
=========================

* Using Agent-Based Modelling to infer governments' policy priorities
* The goals of the government are set with respect to the SDG
* The microfundations of the model are defined by the dynamics of the central governement and agents in charge of the different policies
* Salacadula magicabula
* Agents have a trade-off between being efficient (increase political reputation) or not (e.g. extract personal gains)
